## 1.2.1

*   **✨ New Feature: Image Watermarking** — You can now use asset image paths for the watermark overlay by passing `imagePath` and `imageSize` to `WatermarkConfig`.
*   **📂 Tiled or Centered Rendering** — Automatically tiles the image watermark across the screen by default, or shows it once centered with `repeat: false`.
*   **🛠 Layout Stability Fix** — Explicitly set `alignment: Alignment.topLeft` for `Stack` widgets in `WatermarkOverlay` to prevent the "No Directionality widget found" error when the package is used at the root level.
*   **📖 Improved Documentation** — Reorganized the README with clearer examples for both text and image mode watermarks.
*   **🎨 Watermark Customization** — Easily customizable with opacity, angle, color, and tiled repeating mode.
